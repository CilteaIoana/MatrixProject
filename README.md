# 🐍 Snake Game

This project brings a refreshing twist to the traditional Snake game. Instead of a snake, players control a single point that constantly moves on an LED matrix. The objective is to "eat" as many apples 🍏 (represented by LEDs) as possible within a 15-second timeframe.

## 🌟 Key Functionalities

### 1. 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
- The game's core mechanic revolves around a point moving across an LED matrix, aiming to consume as many apples as possible.
- The movement of the point is controlled using a joystick.
- A timer ⏲ counts down from 15 seconds, within which players try to achieve the highest score.

### 2. 📊 Scoring and Time Display
- The current score and remaining time are dynamically displayed on an LCD screen.
- After the 15-second gameplay, the game automatically returns to the main menu on the LCD.

### 3. 📢 Initial Welcome Message
- Upon starting the program, a welcome message is briefly displayed on the LCD, creating an engaging start to the game.

### 4. 🔧 Menu Functionalities
- **🔆 Matrix Brightness Adjustment**: Players can adjust the brightness of the LED matrix, enhancing the visual experience.
- **💡 LCD Brightness Control**: The brightness of the LCD can also be adjusted for better visibility and comfort.
- **ℹ️ About Section**: This menu option provides information about the game, including a link to your GitHub profile and your name, offering insight into the creator behind the project.

### 5. 🔍 Potentiometer for LCD Contrast
- A potentiometer is integrated to adjust the LCD's contrast, ensuring optimal readability under various lighting conditions.
